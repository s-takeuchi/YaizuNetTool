StkFw 1.6.0
=================================================
1.Summary of StkFw

StkFw is a test support software solution that simulates environments in
which multiple pieces of software and/or hardware work together on an
IP network.
In the development of software designed to work and cooperate with complex
and valuable elements (software and/or hardware) on a network, the use of
a testing program that simulates network element behavior is a well-known
solution for reducing overall development costs.
However, if the behavior (i.e., communication with other network elements)
of the software being developed is complex, the initial costs of creating
a test program may be high.

StkFw can be used to facilitate the control of data communication on an
IP network based on its superior user interface. It simulates behavior
identical to that of testing programs and reduces the overall cost of
testing during the target software's development by eliminating the need
to create a dedicated testing program.
