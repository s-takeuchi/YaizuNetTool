<H2 ID="1.1">1.1 Summary of StkFw</H2>

StkFw is a test support software solution that simulates environments in which multiple pieces of software and/or hardware work together on an IP network.<p>

In the development of software designed to work and cooperate with complex and valuable elements (software and/or hardware) on a network, the use of a testing program that simulates network element behavior is a well-known solution for reducing overall development costs.<br>
However, if the behavior (i.e., communication with other network elements) of the software being developed is complex, the initial costs of creating a test program may be high.<p>

StkFw can be used to facilitate the control of data communication on an IP network based on its superior user interface.<br>
It simulates behavior identical to that of testing programs and reduces the overall cost of testing during the target software's development by eliminating the need to create a dedicated testing program.<p>

StkFw has the following features:<p>
<ul>
<li>The user can define the data flow to describe icons and relative lines between them for receipt, dispatch and alteration of data. This facilitates the definition of complex communication processes on the network.</li>
<li>The user can configure alteration types and conditions for data alteration processes. Detailed behavior of testing programs can also be simulated.</li>
<li>A loopback adapter installation tool and a multiple IP address configuration tool are provided. These can be used for simulating the behavior of multiple network elements on a local computer only.</li>
</ul>
